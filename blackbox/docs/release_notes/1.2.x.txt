Upgrade Guide
=============

.. NOTE::

   To upgrade to the the 1.2.x release series, you must first be running the
   latest version of the :ref:`1.1.x_series`.

Daemon User
-----------

Since :ref:`version_1.2.0`, you cannot run CrateDB as the superuser on
Unix-like systems. Instead, you must create a new ``crate`` user for running
the CrateDB daemon.

System Properties
-----------------

Prior to :ref:`version_1.2.0`, CrateDB allowed you to pass in configuration
values via the use of command-line system properties, like so::

    sh$ ./bin/crate -Ccluster.name=cluster

This is no longer possible. You must update your scripts as necessary.

Bind Address
------------

In :ref:`version_1.2.0`, the default bind address was changed from `0.0.0.0` to
the loopback address. If you want to keep binding to a public IP, you must add
the following line to your :ref:`configuration` file::

    network.host: 0.0.0.0

Configuration Settings
----------------------

Some configuration settings and files were renamed or removed in 1.2.x. You
must review the release notes for :ref:`version_1.2.0` and update your setup as
necessary.

Time Values
-----------

The parsing of time values changed in :ref:`version_1.2.0`. You must update your
application code accordingly.
